Design Choices:
A predominantly black color scheme has been selected across most of the pages. This is not only optimal for eye comfort, but it also aligns with user preferences, as many people favor dark mode when available.
The black background complements the photo gallery's theme, as it keeps the focus on the images without distracting from them. The minimalistic design further enhances this goal, ensuring that the main emphasis is on showcasing the photos.
